# AFFiNE Bun Workers

This repository serves for the development of workers for the self-hosted version of AFFiNE until a proper solution is added to the main repository.

The workers are basically a Bun server running and handling requests for proxying images and fetching metadata from a link.

This repository is NOT affiliated with AFFiNE in any way, it is just a temporary solution for self-hosted users.

## Thanks

A big thanks to the AFFiNE team for creating such a great tool and to [eikaramba](https://github.com/eikaramba) for heavily inspiring this project
with their [work](https://github.com/eikaramba/affine-workers). Also a big thanks to Bun for simply existing.

## Usage

## Development
